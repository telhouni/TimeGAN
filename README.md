Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks for Mental Health Monitoring
========================================================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Time-series Generative Adversarial Network (TimeGAN) adapted for evaluating synthetic data generation techniques. The primary focus is on monitoring severe mental illness symptoms using the CrossCheck datasets. This work is part of a Master's thesis in Computer Science.

The TimeGAN model, as introduced by Jinsung Yoon, Daniel Jarrett, and Mihaela van der Schaar in their 2019 NeurIPS paper, demonstrates the potential of GANs in generating realistic time-series data. This project extends their work to the domain of mental health, with a particular emphasis on creating synthetic datasets that respect the privacy of individuals while providing rich data for research.


Data
----

The CrossCheck dataset used in this study is not included in this repository due to privacy and ethical considerations. Researchers interested in using the CrossCheck data must obtain it directly from the original providers under their data use agreements.
